# JDeserialize fork.


Original jdeserialize you can found at (https://github.com/unsynchronized/jdeserialize)
The original package was initially supported by Google, but is public domain at the moment.

In case of further development of this project, it is going to be licensed according to BSD license.

## Plans

I found the original tool quite useful in work with some old serialized java objects, when the original source code is not available or has
change dramatically since actual serialization. The tool was not initially intended to be used as a library, rather as a standalone applicaiton. I want to make it available as a library for deserialization and/or converting into JSON.

The tool is written relatively long time ago, so I needed some more stuff, plus ability to integrate it into modern tooling (like maven).
